# PokemonGo

Within this repo, there is a folder that holds all the different Pokemon data sets that I downloaded from this [website](https://swhui.github.io/StatisticsinPokemon/datasets/) for this project. The folder is called PGarchive.

There is a Jupyter notebook that is where I read the different data sets in and cleaned it up quite a bit, I talked about this more in my Blog 3a.

Also within this repo is a file where I took the cleaned Pokemon data and created some plots using Plotly Express. I then saved those graphs into a folder entitled EDAplots. You can see more about this in my Blog 3b.

Here is the link to my blog, very cleverly entitled [Data Abby](https://abbywadsworth.github.io/my386blog/) where you can read about my experience in Data Science.
